## Usage

Run `devkit` with the desired commands and options:

```bash
devkit [command] [options]
```

### Commands

#### Node Management
- **`start`**: Start the development node and monitor transactions in real-time.
  - Additional options and prompts will allow you to send funds via the faucet.
  - **Keyboard Shortcuts**:
    - `f`: Open faucet interface
    - `b`: Check balance of an address
    - `q`: Gracefully stop the node
    - `Ctrl+C`: Force stop the node

#### Wallet Management
- **`wallet`**: Configure and manage local HDWallets.
  - **`add`**: Add or generate a new mnemonic in the keystore.
    - Supports both generation and word-by-word import
    - BIP-39 word list validation
  - **`delete`**: Remove a non-default mnemonic from the keystore
  - **`select`**: Select the active mnemonic for use.
  - **`show`**: Display the currently active mnemonic.
  - **`private-key`**: Manage private keys.
    - Options:
      - `--derivation-path [path]`: Specify a custom derivation path for the private key.
      - `--espace`: Use the eSpace network (default).
      - `--core`: Use the Core network.
      - `--index [index]`: Specify the index for key derivation (default: 0).

#### Configuration Management
- **`config`**: View and update configuration settings.
  - **`view`**: Display the current configuration.
  - **`update`**: Interactively update configuration settings via a menu.
    - Customize RPC ports
    - Set block intervals
    - Configure chain IDs
    - Update mining author

## Examples

### Starting the Node
```bash
devkit start
```

This will initialize the development node and allow you to monitor transactions. Use the following shortcuts while monitoring:
- **`f`**: Use the faucet to send funds.
- **`b`**: Check address balance.
- **`q` or `Ctrl+C`**: Stop the node and exit.

### Managing Wallets
```bash
# Add a new wallet
devkit wallet add

# Select active wallet
devkit wallet select

# Get private key for eSpace
devkit wallet private-key --espace --index 0

# Get private key for Core
devkit wallet private-key --core --index 0
```

### Configuration Management
```bash
# View current config
devkit config view

# Update config interactively
devkit config update
```

This will provide an interactive menu to update configuration options such as port numbers, chain IDs, and block intervals.
